Code of Conduct
===============

OrigamiTower is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone,
regardless of gender or anything to do with it (identity, history, expression,
non-binary gender, etc.), sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race, religion, and programming background. We do not tolerate
harassment of community participants in any form, and sexual language and
imagery is not appropriate for any community activity. Community participants
violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the
discretion of the community organizers. Any money paid to the community or any
activities associated with the community is forfeit on expulsion.

Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender or anything to do with
it (identity, history, expression, non-binary gender, etc.), sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
programming experience or background, sexual images in public spaces,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
recording, sustained disruption of community activities, spaces, or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
comply immediately.

All participants in the community and community-associated activities are also
subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, participants should not
use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Staff (including
volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise
create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the community organizers may
take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or
expulsion from the community.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please [contact a member of the community staff
immediately](staff.md).

Community staff will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement
or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe. We value your
participation.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all community venues (including
online venues) and social events associated with the community.

For any questions or with any concerns at all, please
[contact our community staff](staff.md).
